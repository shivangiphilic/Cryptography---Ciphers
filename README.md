# Cryptography---Ciphers
Code to encrypt using 4 types of ciphers - Shift, Vignere, Hill and Playfair, complete with front-end. 
First, we programmed all the 4 ciphers in C++ and then, converted it to JS, which enables us to link it to the HTML files. 
This repo contains all the files you you need to download to run this project. Just download them all and keep them in the same folder. 
Index.html is the main webpage. Open it in a browser to use the encryption functionality.
